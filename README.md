# 65Platform

Let's program like it's 1983! My goal with this project is to create a fun "super powered retro" platform that runs 6502 code.


Uses (Aaron Mell's Net6502 core)[https://github.com/aaronmell/6502Net]. Net6502 is included under the 2-Clause BSD license.
* This version of Net6502 adds 65c02 opcodes.
 
Runs at approximately 144mhz on my 4ghz 2014 intel machine.
